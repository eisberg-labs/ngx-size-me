## Installation

```bash
npm install @eisberg-labs/ngx-size-me --save
```

## Usage

First import to your module:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    SizeMeModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
}

```

Then, use the directive in your component's HTML:

```typescript
<div sizeMe (resize)="logResize($event)"></div>
```

## Demo

## Api

|Option | Data type | Description|
|-------|-----------|------------|
|**monitorWidth** | number | if true, any changes to your component's width will trigger a recalculation|
|**monitorHeight** | boolean | if true, any changes to your component's height will trigger a recalculation|
|**refreshRate** | number | Frequency of detecting element changes (milliseconds). Default is 16ms.|
|**refreshMode** | 'throttle' or 'debounce' | Mode in which refreshing should occur.|

When recalculation is triggered, directive's state is updated with new width, height and position (left, right, top,
bottom).
When a state is updated, component can be notified either by binding an event trigger like:

```typescript
<div sizeMe (resize)="logResize($event)" > </div>

```

Or by binding updates to a property:

```typescript
<div sizeMe [state]="size"></div>
```
