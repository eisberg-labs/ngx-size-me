# Ngx Size Me
> Responsive component for Angular, inspired by [react-size-me](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-size-me). Lightweight angular directive that makes your components aware of width, height and position.


## Installation
```bash
npm install @eisberg-labs/ngx-size-me --save
```

## Usage

First import to your module:
```typescript
   @NgModule({
     declarations: [
       AppComponent
     ],
     imports: [
       BrowserModule,
       SizeMeModule
     ],
     providers: [],
     bootstrap: [AppComponent]
   })
   export class AppModule { }

```
And use in your component html
```typescript
<div sizeMe (resize)="logResize($event)"></div>
```

## Demo
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/angular-15-ngx-size-me-uy7sew?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
        style={{'width': '100%', 'height':'500px', 'border':0, 'border-radius': '4px', 'overflow':'hidden'}}
        title="angular-15-ngx-size-me"
        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

## Api

|Option | Data type | Description|
|-------|-----------|------------|
|**monitorWidth** | number | if true, any changes to your component's width will trigger a recalculation|
|**monitorHeight** | boolean | if true, any changes to your component's height will trigger a recalculation|
|**refreshRate** | number | Frequency of detecting element changes (milliseconds). Default is 16ms.|
|**refreshMode** | 'throttle' or 'debounce' | Mode in which refreshing should occur.|

When recalculation is triggered, directive's state is updated with new width, height and position (left, right, top, bottom).
When a state is updated, component can be notified either by binding an event trigger like:

```typescript
<div sizeMe (resize)="logResize($event)"></div>

```
or by binding updates to a property:
```typescript
<div sizeMe [state]="size"></div>
```
